# Binder environment for interactive NGSolve


This repo is just a container to offer a computing environment where
NGSolve is installed together with some standard python modules.
Using
[binder](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder/workshop-presentations/zero-to-binder-python.md),
this environment can be used to serve different contents from
different repos.  To separate the content and the environment, we
follow the experiences [detailed by
others](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/tip-speed-up-binder-launches-by-pulling-github-content-in-a-binder-link-with-nbgitpuller/922).


The following content repos can be launched in this environment:

- Content from Jay Gopalakrishnan, Portland State University
