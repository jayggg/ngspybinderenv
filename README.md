# An environment for interactive NGSpy


This repo is just a container to offer a computing environment where
NGSolve is pre-installed together with its python interface NGSpy and a few 
other standard python modules. Using
[binder](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder/workshop-presentations/zero-to-binder-python.md), this environment can be used to serve different contents from
different repos.  To separate the content and the environment, we
follow the experiences [detailed by
others](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/tip-speed-up-binder-launches-by-pulling-github-content-in-a-binder-link-with-nbgitpuller/922).  You can certainly launch this repo in binder (just click here 	[![this container](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jayggg/ngspybinderenv.git/master?filepath=TestNgsolve.ipynb)) but the intent is to serve further content developed elsewhere.


The following content repos can be launched in this environment:

- Content from Jay Gopalakrishnan, Portland State University

- Content from NGSolve i-Tutorials	(ngsolve.org)
