# Binder environment repo for NGSolve


This repo provides a environment to experiment with NGSolve together
with some standard python modules.  To separate the content and the
environment, we follow the experiences [detailed by others](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/tip-speed-up-binder-launches-by-pulling-github-content-in-a-binder-link-with-nbgitpuller/922).
